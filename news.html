            <h1>French Programming Language</h1>
            <p>
                FPL is a programming langage by Program. <br>
                The goal of this project: create French language.<br>
                It means, we will use french words in this programming language! <br>
                To give an example, mainly we use the word <italic>print</italic> to send a message in the console.<br>
                In this language, we will use <italic>envoyer</italic> (= send). <br>
                Why this project? Python can not be understandable for every students.<br>
                This is a reason why I am going to do this project.
